"""Talking-head planning core — shared by the worker task and the local-render API.

Extracted from ``services/worker/tasks.py`` so the desktop app's local-render flow
reuses the exact same behavior, with geometry supplied as parameters instead of
read from disk.

Content decisions are settled upstream in ``elevenlabs_stt.run_transcription``:
Scribe removes fillers and false starts itself (``no_verbatim``), low-confidence
tokens are dropped by log-probability, and the silent spans worth keeping are the
ones carrying a tagged audio event. By the time ``segments``/``silence_gaps``
reach :func:`build_talking_head_timeline` those decisions are final; this module
only assembles cuts from them and applies mechanical (non-judgment) cleanup — no
LLM calls of any kind.

    ``duration_mode``/``target_duration_sec`` are accepted only for backward
    compatibility with existing DB rows (legacy values like "custom"/"auto") —
    there is only one behavior now, so both are ignored.

    ``silence_gaps`` (from ``run_transcription``, already Gemini-reviewed) are
    silent spans between speech segments worth keeping — e.g. a wordless
    product-reveal beat. They are merged in as their own cuts alongside the
    speech cuts before mechanical cleanup.

    ``wav_path`` turns on the waveform pass — the same one speech_highlights
    runs, for the same reason. Everything above reasons about word timings, and
    Scribe stretches a trailing word over the pause after it: measured on real
    audio, a one-syllable word claimed 1.85 s while the room went quiet after
    0.3 s. To a cutter reading timestamps there is no pause there at all, which
    is how a mode named "ตัดช่วงเงียบ" kept ~20% of some clips as silence. The
    waveform sees it, so it decides: first remove the pauses inside kept
    ranges, then verify no edge — new or old — sits on live speech. Omit it and
    the behaviour is exactly as before.
